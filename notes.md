# Blasphemy: A Very Short Introduction, Yvonne Sherwood
- Heemskerck's Man of Sorrow's erection debate 
- Blasphemy historically not a crime against God or sacred things, but a crime against the social order. 
- During the rise of secularism, blasphemy was used to promote social reform - to fight for birth control, socialism and freedom of press.
- Blasphemy can also be used to oppress religious minorities. For example, cartoons of Muhammad being used as culural "electroshock therapy" for immigrants into secular countries.
- The leader of Egypt refused to hold a competition to produce cartoons that would be offensive to the west arfter the "Danish cartoon affair".
- Muslim protesters couldn't legally challenge *The Satanic Verses* because only Anglican Christianity was protected under blasphemy laws in the UK at the time. 
- The definition of blasphemy was gradually expanded to include all religions (sometimes including no religion) in law.
- Hate speech laws can be seen as a further evolution of blasphemy law.
